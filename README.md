# Home-weather

A weather app that consumes the open weather api

## How to run
in the home-weather-wind directory first run 
npm install
to grab node_modules then run
npm run dev
to start up the front end server on port http://localhost:3000

Then in the home-weather-backend run
npm install
to again grab the required node_modules then run
npm run start
to start up the back end (running on http://localhost:5000 but this is taken care of by a proxy in the frontend)
