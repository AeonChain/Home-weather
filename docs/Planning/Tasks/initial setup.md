# tasks
- [ ] setup react project
- [x] git
- [x] project planning

### project planning
break down the pdf into tasks

### git
get git initialised 

### react setup
just about sorted, went through next.js 

# Assessment Criteria 
We analyse your coding challenge submission using several criteria, amongst these: 
- Code quality
- Readability
- Relevant technology selection and implementation
- Pragmatic design choices
- Good testing practices
- Consistent coding techniques
- Evidence of some functional testing - (e.g. a reasonably robust deliverable)
- Supportability
- The breadth of skills demonstrated 

It is expected that the challenge would take no more than two or three evenings to complete. Please consider that you may be required to reason about your solution, justify implementation and design choices you have made and demo your solution during your interview.
# The App: Weather Alert 
Implement a React/NodeJS website that will allow the user to check the wind conditions and forecast at one or more locations around the world.

# Notes
React and node, react's documentation recommend that i use next.js if using these two for server side rendering, (future proofs it?)
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#nextjs
"[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a popular and lightweight framework for **static and server‑rendered applications** built with React. It includes **styling and routing solutions** out of the box, and assumes that you’re using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as the server environment."


https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs/what-is-nextjs
Next js is a react framework it seems that tackles some of the complex issues.

Assumes usage of node.js which we're using for the project so i'll use that. just going to follow this for starters and if i run into issues i can always just rebuild the app from scratch using the code and html
